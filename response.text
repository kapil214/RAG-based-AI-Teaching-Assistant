I'd be happy to help with your web development course. Go ahead and ask your questions about the videos. I'll do my best to guide you and provide helpful responses.

(Also, just a heads up: if you need any help with anything outside of this specific video chunk or course material, I can only assist with topics related to the course curriculum.)
